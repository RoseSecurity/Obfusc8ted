You and the AppleLabs' Incident Response Team have been notified of a potential breach to a Human Resources' workstation. According to the Human Resources representative, they did not notice any anomalous activity while browsing the web, but the AppleLabs' system information and event management (SIEM) instance alerted on a suspicious domain. Moments later, the host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) alerted on several malicious programs acting as potential keyloggers. While the AppleLabs' IT and Incident Response Teams struggle to find the answers, can you lend us your digital forensic experience to hunt down this threat actor?
